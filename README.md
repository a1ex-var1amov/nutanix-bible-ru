# Nutanixbible.ru

Here is the translation of the Nutanix Bible written initially by Steven Poitras.
I made the first translation in 2012, then re-created it in ~2018.
Currently, it is out of date, but it is still available.

Why did I translate it? Initially, I just needed some materials for the project documentation. 
Then, I realized I had translated too much, enough to wrap up the website. 

If you have any ideas or suggestions, please ping me, don't hesitate to open a PR, etc.

Thank you!
